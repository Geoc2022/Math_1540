If there exists another \(q(x) \in F[x]\) with \(q(a) = 0\), monic irreducible, then \((p-q)(x) = 0\) at \(a\) and \(deg(p-q) < deg(p)\) which contridicts the first part.

\begin{definition}[E/F as vector-space]
	\label{def:e/f as vector-space}
	We call the degree of \(\frac{E}{F}\) = \([E:F]\)
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	\(\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is a 3-dimentional extension 
\end{example} 
\begin{example}
	\(Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})\) is 4-dimentional extension
\end{example} 

\begin{theorem}
	Let \(p(x) \in F[x]\)  be irreducible of \(deg(p) = d\) then \(E = F[x]/(p(x))\) is an extension of degree \(d\)
\end{theorem}
\begin{note}
	\(E\) contains a root of \(p(x)\), \(a\). We should claim that an F-basis of \(E\) looks like powers of \(a\) 
\end{note} 

% Let's assume that we can find some F-coefficeants \(c_i\)s for which \(c_0 + c_1 a \ldots c_{d-1}a^{d-1} = 0\) Then we have a polynomial \(f(x) = c_0 + c1 x \ldots c_{d-1}x^{d-1}\), but that's a contradiction since it has degree less than \(p\)

% We can write any \(f(x) \in f[x]\) as \(q(x)p(x) + r(x)\). \(\bar{f(x)} = \bar{r(x)}\) therefore \([E:F] \leq d\)

\begin{definition}[Field Extension]
	\label{def:field extension)}
	\[
		F(a_1 \ldots a_n) = \bigcap_{F \subseteq S \subseteq E} S
	\]
	where \(a_1, \ldots a_n \in S\) 
\end{definition}  

\begin{definition}[simple]
	\label{def:simple}
	a field extension is called simple if it only adds one element
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	\(E/F\) is a finite extension \(\implies\) it's algebraic (each element \(a \in E\) is algebraic)
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof}
	Pick a \(a \in E\) if \(a\) is a root if there's a linear combination of it's powers that equals zero 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Let \(E/F\) be field extension, \(a \in E\)  be algebraic over F
	then \begin{enumerate}
		\item There's a monic irreducible \(p(x) \in F[x]\) having \(a\) as a root
		\item There exists an isomorphism between \(F[x]/(p(x)) \to F(a)\)
		\item \(p(x)\) unique monic of the least degree in \(F[x]\) with \(a\) as a root
		\item \([F(a):F] = deg(p)\)    
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
