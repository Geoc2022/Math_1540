\emph{Book Problems:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[55.]
    If \((f,g) = h \neq 1\), then there must exist an extension field of \(F\), \(E\), which contains a root of \(h\) which is common between \(f\) and \(g\) since \((f,g) = h\)

    Else, \((f,g) = 1\), then there exists no field \(E\) containing both \(F\) and a common root of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) since \((\exists a, b \in F)(af + bg = 1)\) implies \(f\) and \(g\) share no roots (\(a(x)f(x)+ b(x)g(x) = 1 \neq 0\) for all \(x\)).   

    \item[56.] 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)]
    Let \(f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x \ldots + a_n x^n \) then:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        (f(x))^p = (a_0 + a_1 x \ldots + a_n x^n)^p \\
        = a_0^p + a_1^p (x)^p \ldots + a_n^p (x^n)^p 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    Because of Fermat's Little Theorem \(a^p \equiv a \pmod p\):
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        = a_0 + a_1 (x)^p \ldots + a_n (x^n)^p \\
        = a_0 + a_1 (x^p) \ldots + a_n (x^p)^n \\
        = f(x^p) 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    \item[(ii)] If we replace \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) with an infinite field, \(F\), of characteristic \(p\) we can be no longer sure that Fermat's Little Theorem holds for all \(a_i\) in \(f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x \ldots + a_n x^n \). \(x^p - x\) only has \(p\) roots, and they are only the elements \(\mathbb{Z}_p \subset F\). \(a_i\) could be in \(F\) and not \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), so we are left will a less strong result: \((f(x))^p = a_0^p + a_1^p x^p \ldots + a_n^p (x^p)^n = g(x^p)\)  
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[61.] Let's factor \(x^8 - x\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) 
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        x^8 - x \\
        x(x^7 - 1) \\
        x(x-1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)
    \end{eqnarray*}
    Since we are in \(\mathbb{Z}_2\), \(3 = 1\) and we can factor it further:  
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        x(x-1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + 3x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) \\
        x(x-1)(x^3+x+1)(x^3+x^2+1)  
    \end{eqnarray*}
    Now we can use either \(x^3+x+1\) or \(x^3+x^2+1\). I will use \(x^3+x+1\).
    \(\mathbb{Z}_2/(x^3+x+1) \cong \mathbb{F}_8\) so our elements will be \(1, x, x + 1, x^2, x^2 + 1, x^2 + x, x^2 + x + 1\)
    
    Therefore, our addition table will look like:
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[scale=.45]{F8+.png} 
    \end{align*}
    
    And, our multiplication table will look like
    
    \begin{align*}
        \includegraphics[scale=.45]{F8*.png}
    \end{align*}

    (Sorry for the non LaTeX, the tables were giving a lot of trouble)

    \item[62.] If \(\mathbb{F}_4\) was isomorphic to a subfield of \(\mathbb{F}_8\), there would have to be a field extension of \(\mathbb{F}_4\) to \(\mathbb{F}_8\), a \(\mathbb{F}_4\) vector space of dimension \(n\); however this would imply \(\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}, 4^n = 8\), which is not possible, so it is not possible that \(\mathbb{F}_4\) is isomorphic to a subfield of \(\mathbb{F}_8\).
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Given Problems:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.] \(f\) has no repeated roots if and only if \((f,f^\prime) = 1\) is equivalent to \(f\) has repeated roots if and only if \((f,f^\prime) \neq 1\)
    
    Assume \(f(x)\) has repeated roots then \(f(x) = (x-\alpha)^k g(x)\) where \((\alpha)\) is a repeated root. If \(f(x) = (x-\alpha)^k g(x)\), then \(f^\prime(x) = k(x-\alpha)^{k-1}g(x) + (x-\alpha)g^\prime (x) = (x-\alpha)(k (x-\alpha)^{k-2} g(x) + g^\prime (x))\). Therefore, \((x-\alpha) | (f, f^\prime) \implies (f, f^\prime) \neq 1\)
    
    Assume \((f,f^\prime) \neq 1\) then \((f,f^\prime)\) is a non-constant polynomial, \(h(x)\). Then \(f = h(x)g_1(x)\) and \(f^\prime = h(x)g_2(x)\) Therefore, \(f\) and \(f^\prime\) share roots of \(h(x)\) and so \(f\) has repeated roots. 

    \item[2.] 
    Let \(f = h f^\prime\) and \(g = h g^\prime \) where \(h, f^\prime, g^\prime \in F[x]\) and \(f^\prime\) and \(g^\prime\) are relatively prime.   

    Then \(\exists a,b \in F\) s.t:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        af^\prime  + bg^\prime = 1 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    which is equivalent to
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        h(af^\prime  + bg^\prime) = h(1) \\
        h af^\prime  + h bg^\prime = h \\
        af + bg = h 
    \end{eqnarray*}

    Since \(\exists a,b \in E\)
    \[
        af^\prime  + bg^\prime = 1
    \]
    in \(E\), this implies
    \[
        af + bg = h
    \]

    Therefore, \((f,g)_F = (f,g)_E = h\) 

    % Let \(h = (f, g)_F\) and \(j = (f, g)_E\)

    % \(h \in E[x]\) so \(h | f,g \implies h|j\)

    % \((\exists a, b \in F[x])(a f + b g = h)\) and \(a, b \in E[x]\) so \(h \in (j) \implies j | h\)
    
    % Since \(j | h\) and \(h | j\), \(h = j\)  

    \item[3.] Eisenstein's Criterion says that if you have a polynomial $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \hdots + a_{1}x + a_{0}$, and a prime $p$ dividing each $a_{i}$ for $0 \leq i < n$, but $p$ doesn't divide $a_{n}$ and $p^{2}$ doesn't divide $a_{0}$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$. For \(f(x) = x^n - m\), the conditions to meet the criterion are simplified to \(p | m \wedge p \nmid 1 \wedge p^2 \nmid m\) since \(a_0 = m\) and \(a_n = 1\). Let \(m\) be expressed as a prime factorization \(p_1\ldots p_n\). By the definition of square free \((\forall p \in {p_1\ldots p_n})(p^2 \nmid m)\). Therefore, \((\forall p \in {p_1\ldots p_n})(p | m \wedge p \nmid 1 \wedge p^2 \nmid m)\).

    \item[4.] Let \(f(x) = x^4 + 6x^3 + 12x^2 + 6x + 1\) Let's apply a coordinate transformation to \(f(x)\). Since a coordinate transformation does not change whether a polynomial is irreducible, we can pick a clever coordinate transformation to make the problem simpler. Since there are multiple terms with positive coefficients that are multiples of \(6\) making a coordinate transformation of \(x-1\) might be a good choice. \(f(x -1) = 2 - 4x + 2x^3 + x^4\) Now we can use Eisenstein's Criterion more easily. Recall Eisenstein's Criterion says that if you have a polynomial $g(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \hdots + a_{1}x + a_{0}$, and a prime $p$ dividing each $a_{i}$ for $0 \leq i < n$, but $p$ doesn't divide $a_{n}$ and $p^{2}$ doesn't divide $a_{0}$, then $g(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$. Using Eisenstein's criterion on \(f(x - 1)\) , we can see that a prime \(p = 2\) divides each $a_{i}$ for $0 \leq i < n$ (\(2 | 2,-4, 2\)), $p = 2$ doesn't divide $a_{n} = 1$, and $p^{2} = 4$ doesn't divide $a_{0} = 2$; therefore, $f(x - 1)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$ and so $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.
